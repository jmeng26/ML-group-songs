**Background:** Spotify is one of the most famous Music Platforms to discover new music. The company uses a lot of different algorithms to recommend the user new music based on their music preferences and most of these recommendations are located in Playlists. These Playlists are created for different users based on a wide diversity of music genres and even Spotify is capable to recommend new music based on moods. Music has been in my daily routine all my life, It’s a kind of drug that I need when I’m doing housework, working, workouts, and so on. Basically, I'm playing it all the time. I have a lot of music on Spotify that I always wanted to separate according to the similarities of the songs and save them into different playlists that I can play the specific playlists based on my mood or my requirements.

**Objective:** Use Spotify API and K-Means to download my song list and group songs by similarity then create my customized playlists.

**Hypothesis:** The simplest way is to groups songs for the energetic group and relaxed group. Based on their feature we can categorize my song list into two groups.

**Tools Used:** Python Pandas, Numpy for data analysis; Sklearn to build the Machine Learning model; Spotipy Python Library; Spotify Credentials to access Api Database and Playlists Modify, Matplotlib

**Skills Demonstrated:** Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning(K-Means), Data Visualization
